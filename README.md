Task 1 Face Mask Detection

To create a Face Mask Detection system in Python:

1. Collect a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.

2. Preprocess and augment the data.

3. Build a deep learning model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. Train the model on the dataset.

5. Test the model's accuracy and fine-tune as needed.

6. Implement real-time detection using OpenCV or similar tools.

Task 2 Payment Application 

To create a payment application in Python:

1. Set up a development environment.

2. Choose a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).

3. Design a user interface.

4. Implement payment processing functionality.

5. Securely handle transactions and data.

6. Test thoroughly.

7. Deploy the application.

Task 3 Speech to Text

To create a Speech to Text system in Python, follow these steps: 

1.Install necessary libraries like SpeechRecognition.

2. Record or input audio.

3. Use SpeechRecognition to convert audio to text.

4. Process and extract text as needed.

5. Implement error handling and testing for robustness.

6. Fine-tune for better accuracy if necessary
